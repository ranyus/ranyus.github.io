# Biography

I'm a permanent researcher at the [Ubiquitous Internet](https://ui.iit.cnr.it/en/) group of [IIT-CNR](https://www.iit.cnr.it/en/) in Italy.
{style="text-align: justify;"}
I design and develop machine learning and distributed learning algorithms for resource-constrained devices, mainly targeting the Edge/IoT and Industry 4.0 domains.
{style="text-align: justify;"}
In the past, I worked on cellular traffic offloading solutions based on Reinforcement Learning and autonomic data dissemination algorithms for opportunistic networks.
